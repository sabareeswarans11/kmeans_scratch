# kmeans_scratch
1)	Randomly choosing Centroids
2)	finding the distance between centroids and all the data points using Euclidean distance formula
3)	Update the Centroid with the minimum Distance
4)	Repeating the above steps (1-3) for a defined number of iterations
5)	Return center,mean_intra_cluster_distance,mean_inter_cluster_distance
